# Instructions

This repository contains a barebones Play application bootstrapped with Doobie and Liquibase for PG. What needs to be implemented:
- A basic signup endpoint.
- A basic login endpoint using the data stored from signup.
- A user-info endpoint that outputs the currently logged-in user’s info.
- A management endpoint to list all users and their info.

Signup must consist of an identifier, a password, and any misc user info.

The main scope of the exercise is in implementing these four endpoints, ideally under an hour.
Final code does not have to be perfect. The rest is carte-blanche, you may add any library you feel necessary.
Discussion will be centered on your implementation choices. We do not wish nor recommend that you spend more time than specified on the exercise.
Instead, you may include code comments to explain how you’d have done something differently with more time.
